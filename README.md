# Task 13 – PCA Dimensionality Reduction

## Objective
To understand dimensionality reduction using PCA and compare model performance before and after reduction.

## Dataset
Sklearn Digits Dataset

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and scaled dataset
- Applied PCA with different components
- Plotted explained variance
- Trained Logistic Regression on original data
- Trained Logistic Regression on PCA-reduced data
- Compared accuracy
- Visualized 2D PCA data

## Results
- PCA reduced dimensions while preserving most variance
- Accuracy with PCA is comparable to original data
- 2D visualization shows class separation

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
